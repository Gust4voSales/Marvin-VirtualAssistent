## ðŸ“œ About
This project uses a voice recognition library to automate actions from the ```commands.json``` file, this way, we can add more voice commands to the file and the assistent will be 
able to do those tasks without changing the code, since most of the tasks are dinamic (you can open up any website you want, 
add a command to open any program you have locally, etc)

Modules:
 - **OpenModule**: open websites and do research inside them, open programs, reload the ```commands.json``` to update the modifications added;
 - **MusicModule**: play music (it's going to get the music from the Youtube's first result) in an **invisible player**, this way it won't remove focus from your gameplay when you request a song for example, pause song, remove song.
 - **AlarmModule**: set reminders
